# Getting Started
Alright, so you've found us, what do you do now? At the moment, you're going to have to compile your own version of the scanner by cloning the server scanner. We recommend using [MCStalker](https://mcstalker.com) or Seethium for an easy to use version. 

## If you're a coder
If you can code, you could try contributing. Our codebase consists of Python, Java, and C++.
* API - Python (Asyncio + Flask)
* Discord Bot - Python (Discord.py + Asyncio + Aiohttp)
* Scanner - C++
* Mod - Java

While TheEtherProject was being dissolved, I lost access to the Mod, so we'll have to start from the beginning there.
